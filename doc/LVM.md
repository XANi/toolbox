## Common stuff
* pvresize --setphysicalvolumesize 40G /dev/md1

## Advanced

### Move  LV within same PV
needed if you need to defragment it (for example when shrinking pv)

`pvmove --alloc anywhere -n Swap /dev/md1 /dev/md1:1000-1200`

`--alloc anywhere allows moving within same device` `/dev/md1:1000-1200` is extent range to move to (must be free ofc). Source also accepts range which can be helpful if you only need to move one part of it

### Recover PV config
* if you can get /etc/lvm/(archive|backup) from backup use that
* if not, DD first 2MB of partition, it should contain LVM config like that:

           contents = "Text Format Volume Group"
           version = 1
           description = "Created *after* executing 'pvresize --setphysicalvolumesize 40G /dev/md1'"
           ...
                   }
               }
           }

    extract it from it to file
* if not, grep partition for it and hope for best... sth like `grep -a -A 1000 'Generated by LVM' /dev/ice`
* Run: `: pvcreate --uuid "<some_long_string>" --restorefile /etc/lvm/archive/VolumeGroupName_XXXXX.vg <PhysicalVolume>
