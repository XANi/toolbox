Children get their parents' last equipped skill (remember that you can rearrange skills using the "Equip Skills" command, the lowest skill on the list is inherited) except for Chrom's children and Inigo - Chrom's daughters get the "Aether" skill, and Chrom's sons get the "Rightful King" skill. Olivia's "Secret Dance" skill cannot be passed to Inigo, as it is locked to the Dancer class.
